# Magic lens
    As the name suggests the app is gonna fetch the unknown data of the valuable surroundings of our eco-system.
With the help of Tamil Literature, we are planning to generate awareness with our website.

## usage:
    People who wants to know about a plant/tree can upload a picture of it, to know more about it.
    Enthusiatics who wanna know about the Tamil literature reference of the species.

## Technologies Used:
    It Works on Express backend which stores the json object having the literature References.
    my Pl@ntnet API to identify the species with their ML model.
    A simple Front end for the UI with file uploading option and user interaction.

## Future Extensions:
    As being a prototype we are having a little collection of references in the backend.
    Extending the reference as much as we can could help people a lot.
    Margining the Medicinal values of a plant would extend the projects value.
